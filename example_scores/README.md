# Interactive Demo Score

Mode 2 requires a MIDI file for interactions. The MIDI file must contain two tracks:
- a melody track -> `track[0]`
- an accompaniment track -> `track[1]`

This folder contains two preprocessed MIDI files:
- schubert_gb.mid: Schubert D.899 Op. 90 No. 3 in Gb major
- sutekidane.mid: 素敵だね from Final Fantasy X
